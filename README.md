Data Analysis Summary for SME
For a recent task, I analyzed sales data from a small dataset to extract insights and inform business decisions. The focus was on two key areas: product category performance and regional revenue distribution.

Product Category Analysis:
Revenue for both product categories was analyzed for January to identify the best-performing category. This insight helps the company determine where to allocate resources and prioritize efforts for future growth. Additionally, an average sales analysis revealed that Smartphones and Smartwatches had above-average total sales, while Laptops, Tablets, and Headphones were below the average.

Regional Revenue Performance:
The revenue by region was assessed to determine the region generating the most revenue. This helps the firm decide whether to maximize efforts in high-performing regions or focus on underperforming areas to boost salesâ€”or potentially pursue both strategies, depending on available resources.

Product Unit Sales:
The number of units sold for each product category highlighted that Smartwatches were the most sold product, while Laptops had the lowest sales. Additionally, Tablets and Laptops fell below the average units sold.

Recommendations
Product Bundling: Bundle Laptops and Smartwatches in the Southern and Western regions to increase sales through cross-promotion.
Promotions: Leverage high-revenue products for promotional campaigns to drive more sales across all regions.
Product Expansion: Introduce all Electronics in the Southern and Western regions, given the higher consumer activity and demand in these areas.
Tablet Bundling: Pair Tablets and Headphones as a bundle to increase Tablet sales, which show high revenue potential.
These recommendations are designed to improve product performance, maximize regional sales, and enhance overall business growth.

The tool used for filtering and analysis was the Pivot Table in Excel.
